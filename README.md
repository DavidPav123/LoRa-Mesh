# Lora-Mesh Network Research

This repository holds the code for my submission for the Fall 2024 UHWO CSRL internship on secure communication over mesh networks.

To-Do:
- Impliment message confirmation to resend packets if an error is received.
- Impliment Encryption.
- Impliment a message too long notification.
  - Message rollover so if the message is larger than 240 Bytes it will roll over into another packet.
